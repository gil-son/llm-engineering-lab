This initial phase focuses on acquiring, preparing, and indexing the external data that the LLM will use to ground its answers, effectively creating the specialized knowledge base.

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3.1.1 Document Loading / Indexing** | The process of gathering raw, unstructured, and structured data from various sources—including local files, external APIs, web scraping, databases, and cloud storage (S3, GCS)—to begin the RAG pipeline. |
| **3.1.2 Preprocessing** | Cleaning and normalizing the raw text through steps like removing noise, performing OCR on scanned documents, language detection, deduplication, and **metadata extraction** (Author, Date, Source, Tags). This is crucial for maximizing data quality before vectorization. |
| **3.1.3 Chunking** | Dividing large documents into smaller, manageable, and semantically coherent text units (chunks). Strategies range from fixed-size and overlapping splits to advanced methods like **Parent-Child** or semantic-adaptive techniques to optimize the retrieved context. |
| **3.1.4 Embedding** | The crucial step of converting the processed text chunks into high-dimensional numerical vectors using a specialized embedding model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text for fast similarity search. |
| **3.1.5 Vector Store / Vector Database** | The specialized storage layer designed to efficiently store and manage the vector embeddings and their associated metadata. It uses advanced indexing algorithms (like HNSW, IVF) and similarity metrics (Cosine Similarity) to enable high-speed retrieval of relevant context. |

This phase executes the "R" in RAG. It involves transforming the user's question into a searchable format and efficiently fetching the most relevant documents from the Vector Store.

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3.2.1 Query Embedding** | Converting the incoming user query into a vector representation using the **exact same embedding model** used during the ingestion phase, ensuring the query and document vectors exist in the same semantic space. |
| **3.2.2 Retriever** | The mechanism responsible for searching the Vector Store. It executes semantic searches, **query transformations** (e.g., decomposition or rewriting via an LLM), hybrid searches (vector + keyword), and applies metadata filters to find and collect the initial set of top-K relevant document chunks. |
| **3.2.3 Ranking & Refinement** | A post-retrieval process that takes the initial set of retrieved chunks and re-scores or filters them using methods like **cross-encoder re-ranking models** or context refinement logic, ensuring only the most relevant and high-quality context is passed to the LLM. |

This phase executes the "G" in RAG. It involves synthesizing the final answer by feeding the LLM with the original query and the newly retrieved, refined context.

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3.3.1 Context Injection** | The process of dynamically constructing the final prompt by interleaving the user's question with the highly-ranked retrieved context chunks, instructing the LLM to answer *only* based on the provided information. |
| **3.3.2 LLM Generation** | The core generative step where the LLM processes the injected context and the user query to produce a fluent and accurate response. **Prompt Engineering** is vital here (System Prompt, Few-shot Examples) to enforce format, tone, and groundedness. |
| **3.3.3 Post-Processing** | Final steps applied to the LLM's output, including summarization, reformatting, providing **source citation/attribution**, and potentially adding a **confidence score** or a reasoning trace for transparency and user trust. |

This final, cyclical phase ensures the RAG system remains accurate, relevant, and robust over time by continuously monitoring performance and updating components.

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3.4.1 Feedback Loop** | The iterative process of monitoring the system's performance, which involves evaluating the quality of **retrieval relevance** and **generation faithfulness (groundedness)**, caching frequent queries, and using both manual and automated feedback to refine and update the index, embeddings, or LLM itself. |

Overall Structure (RAG → INGEST → RETRIEVAL → GENERATION → FEEDBACK)

The four-stage sequence (Ingestion, Retrieval, Generation, Feedback) is the canonical and most accurate way to describe the RAG architecture. It is perfect.
