# NLP-NLU-NLG COMPREHENSION SUMMARY

This document provides a structured overview of the core components and steps involved in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Natural Language Generation (NLG).

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2.1.1 Text Processing / Cleaning / Normalization** | The initial process of preparing raw text by removing noise (e.g., HTML tags, special characters), converting text to a standard case (e.g., lowercasing), and fixing inconsistencies. |
| **2.1.2 Tokenization** | Breaking down the text into smaller units (tokens), which can be words, subwords, or characters, to be used as input for a model. |
| **2.1.3 Embeddings / Vectors** | Representing text tokens (words/subwords) as dense, numerical vectors (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) that capture their semantic and contextual meaning. |
| **2.1.4 Text Splitting** | Dividing long documents into smaller, manageable chunks that respect context boundaries, typically for retrieval or processing by models with context length limits. |
| **2.1.5 Ingestion (Vector Store)** | Storing the numerical text representations (embeddings) into a specialized database (Vector Store) for efficient search and retrieval operations (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma). |

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2.2.1 Intent & Entity Recognition** | **Intent:** Identifying the user's overall goal or action (e.g., "book\_flight"). **Entity:** Extracting specific, structured pieces of information (e.g., "flight date," "destination city"). |
| **2.2.2 Semantic & Syntactic Analysis** | **Semantic:** Analyzing the meaning of the text to understand the relationships between words and concepts. **Syntactic:** Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences (e.g., Part-of-Speech tagging, dependency parsing). |
| **2.2.3 Contextual Disambiguation** | Determining the correct meaning of words or phrases that have multiple interpretations (e.g., resolving the meaning of "bank" in a sentence based on the surrounding context). |
| **2.2.4 Similarity Search (Cosine)** | Using a numerical measure (like Cosine Similarity) on vector representations to find the documents or pieces of information most semantically similar to a user's query. |
| **2.2.5 Knowledge Retrieval** | Fetching relevant facts, documents, or data from a knowledge base (often a Vector Store or Graph Database) to provide comprehensive context for a response. |

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2.3.1 Content Planning** | Deciding what information should be included in the response, based on the NLU output (intent, entities, knowledge), and organizing the high-level message structure. |
| **2.3.2 Sentence Planning** | Determining the grammatical structure, lexical choices, and discourse features (e.g., coherence, tone) for each sentence that will be generated. |
| **2.3.3 Surface Realization** | The final step of turning the abstract sentence plan into a coherent, grammatically correct natural language string using a generation model (e.g., LLM or sequence-to-sequence model). |
| **2.3.4 Post-processing** | Applying final checks and formatting to the generated text, such as grammar correction, ensuring proper punctuation, and enforcing length or style constraints before delivery. |

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2.4.1 Metrics** | Quantifiable scores used to assess system performance. **Classification:** Accuracy, F1-Score. **Generation:** BLEU, ROUGE (for overlap), and Perplexity (for fluency). |
| **2.4.2 Feedback / RL** | Implementing a continuous learning loop where human feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down, corrections) is gathered and used to refine the model, often via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). |
